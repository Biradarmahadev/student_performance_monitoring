# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts students' final grades based on their demographic, social, and academic features using Machine Learning techniques. It is built to help educators identify at-risk students and plan targeted interventions.

---

## 📝 **Problem Statement**

Predict the final grade (**G3**) of students in a Portuguese secondary school based on:
- Personal and demographic data
- School and family details
- Academic behaviors and previous grades

---

## 💾 **Dataset**

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
- **Files:** `student-mat.csv` (Math course), `student-por.csv` (Portuguese course)
- **Attributes:** 33 features including:
  - Demographics: age, sex, address
  - Family: parents’ education, job, relationship status
  - School: school name, study time, failures
  - Grades: G1, G2, G3

## 🚀 **How to Run**

1. **Clone repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-prediction.git
    cd student-performance-prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

3. **Run the script**
    ```bash
    python student_performance.py
    ```

4. **Or open the Jupyter Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook student_performance.ipynb
    ```

---

## 🔨 **Models Used**

- **Random Forest Regressor**
  - Robust to non-linearities
  - Handles feature importance analysis

---

## 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **R² Score**

Example Output:

````

RMSE: 1.80
R2 Score: 0.87

```

---

## 💡 **Possible Improvements**

✅ Convert regression to **classification** (pass/fail)  
✅ Use **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning  
✅ Deploy as a **Streamlit web app** for teachers to use  
✅ Compare with **XGBoost and LightGBM** models  
✅ Perform **feature importance analysis** to find key success factors
